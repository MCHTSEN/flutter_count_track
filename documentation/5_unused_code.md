# Unused Code Analysis

This document analyzes the codebase for unused classes, methods, and files.

## Unused Files

- **`lib/features/order_management/data/models/order.dart`**: This file defines a `Order` model that is very similar to the `Order` model generated by Drift. It seems to be a remnant of a previous implementation and is not used in the current version of the application.
- **`lib/features/order_management/data/models/order_item.dart`**: Similar to the `Order` model, this file defines an `OrderItem` model that is not used in the current version of the application.
- **`lib/features/order_management/data/repositories/order_repository.dart`**: This file defines an `OrderRepository` class that is not used in the current version of the application. The `OrderRepositoryImpl` class implements the `OrderRepository` interface from the `domain` layer.

## Unused Classes and Methods

- **`SampleDataGenerator`**: The `SampleDataGenerator` class in `lib/core/utils/sample_data_generator.dart` is used to generate sample data for the application. However, the `_initializeSampleData` method in `lib/core/database/app_database.dart` already provides this functionality. The `SampleDataGenerator` class could be removed to reduce code duplication.
- **`resetDatabaseProvider`**: The `resetDatabaseProvider` in `lib/core/database/database_provider.dart` is a debug provider that resets the database. This is useful for development, but it should be removed or disabled in the production version of the application.

## Recommendations

- **Remove Unused Files:** The unused `Order`, `OrderItem`, and `OrderRepository` files in the `lib/features/order_management/data` directory should be removed.
- **Consolidate Sample Data Generation:** The `SampleDataGenerator` class should be removed, and the `_initializeSampleData` method in `AppDatabase` should be used for all sample data generation.
- **Remove Debug Providers:** The `resetDatabaseProvider` should be removed or disabled in the production version of the application.
