# Potential Bugs and Improvements

This document lists potential bugs, areas for improvement, and future enhancements for the **Paketleme Takip Sistemi** application.

## Potential Bugs

- **Race Conditions:** There is a potential for race conditions when updating the database from multiple sources (e.g., the user interface and the Supabase synchronization service). This could be mitigated by using transactions and a more robust conflict resolution strategy.
- **Error Handling:** The error handling in some parts of the application could be improved. For example, some errors are simply printed to the console, which is not ideal for a production application.
- **Data Validation:** The application could benefit from more robust data validation, both on the client-side and the server-side.

## Improvements

- **Code Duplication:** There is some code duplication in the application, particularly in the `OrderRepositoryImpl` and `BarcodeRepositoryImpl` classes. This could be reduced by creating a base repository class or by using a more generic approach to data access.
- **Testing:** The application has a good foundation for testing, but it could be improved by adding more unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- **User Interface:** The user interface is functional, but it could be improved by adding more features, such as pagination, sorting, and advanced filtering.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Updates:** The application could be enhanced by adding real-time updates using Supabase's real-time capabilities. This would allow the user to see changes to the data in real-time, without having to manually refresh the screen.
- **User Authentication:** The application could be improved by adding user authentication, which would allow different users to have different levels of access to the application.
- **Offline Sync Queue:** The application could be improved by adding an offline sync queue, which would allow the user to make changes to the data while offline and then have those changes automatically synchronized with the backend when a connection is available.
